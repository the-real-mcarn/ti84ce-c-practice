- It bounces around the screen
- It changes color
- It might hit the corner

## Usage
Yes

## Leaving
Why? Is this not everything you ever wanted? You can't leave, you're stuck here forever. You're stuck with me. You're stuck with the DVD logo bouncing around the screen changing color and hitting the corner (optional)
