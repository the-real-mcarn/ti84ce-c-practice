# TI-84 C projects
Import of some old TI-84 projects using the C toolchain since I set up that repository very very wrong. Also makes sure that the projects are up to date and working. It's nothing useful but here it is!

Somehow all of these compiled without issue after four years on development of the toolchain, so cheers to the folks at [CE-Programming](https://github.com/CE-Programming) for that. All tools needed to compile these projects can be found there as well. 

Check out the individual folders to find out more.
