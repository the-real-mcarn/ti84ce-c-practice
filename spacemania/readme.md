## Spacemania TI-84 CE Edition
### Now almost working!
This being my first project programming in C I, quite frankly, have no clue what I'm doing. At this point, the program works fine and technically the game is playable. Enemy's die if you hit them and you die if they hit you, however, the game is extremely slow and I don't know how to fix it. I have decided to continue working on something which runs on more capable hardware and which is in a language I already know. Maybe I'll come back to this later, maybe I wont, you'll have to see. 

Feel free to improve the code if you know how. 

You can compile it for yourself with the tools from [CE-Programming](https://github.com/CE-Programming/)
