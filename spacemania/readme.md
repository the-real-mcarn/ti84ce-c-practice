## Spacemania TI-84 CE Edition
A sample horizontal shootemup game from the book "HTML Games: Novice to Ninja" that I made for several different platforms a while back as practice. This is my attempt to port it to the TI-84 CE calculator, it didn't go that well and while I'm sure I'd be able to fix it now, that will have to wait for another day.

#### Now almost working!
This being my first project programming in C.

I, quite frankly, have no clue what I'm doing. At this point, the program works fine and technically the game is playable. Enemy's die if you hit them and you die if they hit you, however, the game is extremely slow and I don't know how to fix it. I have decided to continue working on something which runs on more capable hardware and which is in a language I already know. Maybe I'll come back to this later, maybe I wont, you'll have to see. 

You can compile it for yourself with the tools from [CE-Programming](https://github.com/CE-Programming/)
